No Anvil (Name) Limits
================
*for fabric, quilt 1.20.1 (forge and other versions maybe later)*

Simple lightweight mod to effectively remove the Anvil rename limit, lifting from 50 to 32767.

Also has wonky support for newline '\n' characters in the anvil rename box. it will show up as [LF] in the tooltip but will display correctly in chat.
